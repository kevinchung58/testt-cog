# Project TODO & Architectural Overview

This document outlines the current status, architecture, and next steps for the project, focusing on the new Learning Management System (LMS) foundation.

## Architecture

A new frontend application has been created in the `/lms-frontend` directory. This serves as the foundation for a modern, role-based Learning Management System and is intended to be the template for future frontend projects.

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
- **Authentication**: [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language**: TypeScript

This setup was chosen for its modern features, rapid development capabilities, and robust, built-in solutions for authentication and user management.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the new frontend directory: `cd lms-frontend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if it exists) or add the following keys from your Clerk dashboard:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
    - `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Completed Tasks (LMS Foundation)

- [x] **Initialized New Next.js Project**: Created the `lms-frontend` application as a modern foundation.
- [x] **Integrated Clerk for Authentication**: Installed and configured the Clerk SDK.
- [x] **Implemented Basic Auth Flow**: Created sign-in, sign-up, and protected dashboard pages.
- [x] **Defined Core User Roles**: Set up a system to assign a default "student" role to new users via webhooks.
- [x] **Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Created a protected `/admin` route and demonstrated conditional UI rendering based on user roles.
- [x/ **Created Placeholder Dashboards**: Built placeholder pages for Admin, Teacher, and Student roles to establish the app's structure.

## Next Steps & Future Work

The foundation is now in place. Future development should focus on building out the specific features of the LMS.

- **[ ] Flesh out Role Dashboards**: Add actual content and functionality to the Admin, Teacher, and Student dashboards.
- **[ ] Implement Role Management UI**: Create an admin-only UI where administrators can view and change the roles of other users.
- **[ ] Course Creation & Management**:
    -   Allow Teachers to create and manage courses.
    -   Allow Students to enroll in courses.
- **[ ] Lesson & Content Modules**:
    -   Teachers should be able to add lessons (text, video, quizzes) to courses.
    -   Students should be able to view lesson content.
- **[ ] Connect to Backend**: Integrate the `lms-frontend` with the `cognee-backend` by creating API clients to fetch and mutate data.
- **[ ] Refine Permissions**: Add more granular permissions beyond the three basic roles if needed.
- **[ ] Write Frontend Tests**: Add unit and integration tests for the new frontend application using Jest and React Testing Library/Playwright.
